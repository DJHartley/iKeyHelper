# iKeyHelper
--
iKeyHelper is a script for Windows to get AES keys from Apple's iOS Firmware.

iKeyHelper is scripted in Batch. Its features include: formatting for TheiPhoneWiki, decryption of files, use of the Firmware Links API, baseband detection, preparation for bundle making, and much more!

## iKeyHelper uses the following:

* **XPwn** by planetbeing
* **greenpois0n** by chronic-dev
* **irecovery** by westbaer
* **7zip** by Igor Pavlov
* **SSR** by Jonas Reinhardt
* **Binmay** by sloaring
* various parts of **Cygwin**
* ideviceinfo and dll's from **libimobiledevice**

If you want to use iKeyHelper, you must first collect these parts - as a general guidance, you can find the required .exe's in tools.txt.

Also, you need iTunes, libusb (and device filters installed for each mode) for iKeyHelper to function properly.
